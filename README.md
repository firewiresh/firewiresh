Hello! I'm Spencer, also know as FireWire online. 
I'm a Cybersecurity Analyst with extensive experience in linux system administration and networking.

The majority of the repositories here are fairly old and projects from my days in high school.
So a lot of the code is definitely not best practice and more or less kept around to show my progress over the years.

In 2021 I switched to a private self-hosted gitlab server to hold all my miscellaneous coding adventures.
While this profile has been left abandoned over the years, my love of programming hasn't been, and I just recently hit 150+ projects on my private git server!

I hope to share some of my best works here, from here on out.

While programming has been a hobby for me, I'm always trying to learn new techiques and optimizations.
So feel free to submit an issue or a pull request, describing the issue or fix, if you notice something out of place.
